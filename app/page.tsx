            I've had a fascination with the web (and putting Stuff on it) ever
            since tinkering with Geocities and LiveJournal layouts during my
            formative years.

            I put my technical hobbies aside briefly while getting my B.A. in
            English and Philosophy at the University of North Carolina. When I
            took <em>Intro to Javascript</em> as a senior-year elective, I
            discovered an affinity for programming that was new at the time, but
            in retrospect seems like it had already been there and I just hadn't
            realized that I was looking for it.

            I've spent the last two years developing foundational web
            development skills, first self-taught via Free Code Camp and The
            Odin Project, then by completing General Assembly's Software
            Engineering Immersive bootcamp program. Today, I'm a capable
            junior-level programmer who understands how much there still is to
            learn and is eager to learn it. I'd love to work with you on a
            project -- please feel free to reach out.
