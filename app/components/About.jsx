        I've had a fascination with the web (and putting Stuff on it) ever since
        tinkering with Geocities and LiveJournal layouts during my formative
        years.

        I put my technical hobbies aside briefly while getting my B.A. in
        English and Philosophy at the University of North Carolina. When I took{' '}
        <em>Intro to Javascript</em> as a senior-year elective, I discovered an
        affinity for programming that was new at the time, but in retrospect
        seems like it had already been there and I just hadn't realized that I was
        looking for it.

        I've spent the last year developing foundational web development skills,
        first self-taught via Free Code Camp and The Odin Project, then by
        completing General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive bootcamp
        program.  While I'm still a rookie programmer and have lots to learn, I believe I'm off to a strong start and I'm eager to keep learning more.  I'd love to work with you on a project -- please feel free to reach out.
